I've created a MegaSudoku player that one can play from the commandline

Challenge: Build a 25x25 Sudoku Game

So I took the code for this challenge (which you'll find in main.py) and adjusted it to create a 25x25 grid MegaSudoku (main_25x25_grid.py). 
Currently the MegaSudoku can be played via the commandline. My intention is to develop this game so that it can be placed via the browser. 

The original 9x9 game, put together by geeksforgeeks, was intended as a way to auto solve sudoku puzzles. Personally I've adjusted the code to be a place where I can personally solve my MegaSudoku puzzles - so I'm not interested in the auto-solve functionality. I will keep it for whoever wants that functionality when playing the game, but personally that's not what I want from this game.

So why am I doing this? Well I have MegaSudoku puzzles in my book but after erasing so much, the numbers are starting to fade and the paper's getting damaged. So I decided to find a way to play this game on the computer, with the hope that I could play it on my phone in the future.
