I've created a MegaSudoku player that one can play from the commandline

Challenge: Build a 25x25 Sudoku Game

So I took the code for this challenge (which you'll find in main.py) and adjusted it to create a 25x25 grid MegaSudoku (main_25x25_grid.py). 
Currently the MegaSudoku can be played via the commandline. My intention is to develop this game so that it can be placed via the browser.
