I've created a MegaSudoku player that one can play from the commandline

Challenge: Build a 25x25 Sudoku Game

So I took the code for this challenge (which you'll find in main.py) and adjusted it to create a 25x25 grid MegaSudoku (main_25x25_grid.py). 

Steps:
[x] #1: Display a 5x5 grid with lines in between each internal 5x5 grid
[x] #2: The 5x5 MegaSudoku is fully functional and operates as expected
[x] #3: The user can save their progress & load from a save
[ ] #4: Show the numbers that have been completed so far (to the right)
[ ] #5: If user selects a cube with a 5, change the colour for all cubes where the number 5 has already been completed. 
[ ] #6: Create a file, which when run allows the user decide how big they want the sudoku size to be. EG original: 9x9, MegaSudoku16 (16x16), MegaSudoku25 (25x25)
